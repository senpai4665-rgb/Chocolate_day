    <h1>Chocolate Wishes 🍫</h1>
    <p>
        Even when we are apart, you are always with me, in my thoughts, in my smiles,
        in the little moments that suddenly feel special because of you. I admire your
        emotions, your softness, and the way you care so deeply. Your heart is precious,
        and I promise to always treat it gently. If the world ever feels heavy for you,
        I want you to remember that you never have to carry it alone, I’m always right here,
        choosing you, every single day.
